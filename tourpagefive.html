“Snorkeling is possible at most of Bermuda's beaches but Church Bay and Tobacco Bay are widely regarded as the best. Other good places include John Smith's Bay, Warwick Long Bay, Snorkel Park Beach, Hog Bay Park, and Achilles Bay. Church Bay is in Southampton Parish and is a good choice for most tourists.Its near the Fairmont Southampton and the Reefs. It is also on the main bus route between Dockyard and Hamiliton (bus route 7). The reef is close to the shore and home to large parrotfish and other colorful fish. The water can get a little choppy though, and the beach is fairly rocky. There’s a park here with picnic tables and public restrooms.”
