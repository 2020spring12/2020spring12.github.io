“Horseshoe Bay is a well-known beach in Bermuda. As a tourist spot, it lies on the main island's south (Atlantic Ocean) coast, in the parish of Southampton. It is one of two beaches of the same name in Bermuda, with the other located at Tucker's Island: since the 1940s part of a peninsula that housed the former US Naval Operating Base, and is now called Morgan's Point. The sand of Horseshoe Bay's beach is very fine and displays a white colour. The beach is equipped with one lifeguard station which is manned during the summer between 10 AM and 6 PM. There is also a café where lunch can be purchased during the summer months. The same building also provides toilet facilities, showers and a foot-washing area for removing sand before departing.”
