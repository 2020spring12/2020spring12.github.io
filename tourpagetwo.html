“Dolphin Quest Bermuda is a majestic location that extends the dolphins’ habitat outside the museum walls and provides adventurous encounter opportunities. It is located inside the majestic National Museum of Bermuda. It is home to a Dolphin Lagoon, Ocean Habitat, and Dolphin Quest building. Dolphin Quest Bermuda originally opened in 1996 at the Fairmont Southampton Princess Hotel. In 1999, they relocated the animals and operations to a large protected ocean-fed lagoon within a historic fort that is home to the National Museum of Bermuda. The dolphin lagoon is filled with saltwater that enters through a tunnel which connects the facility to the open ocean.”
