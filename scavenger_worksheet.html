<h1> Peer-To-Peer File Sharing</h1>
<h2>Answers For Scavenger Hunt</h2>

  <p>Is peer-to-peer file sharing illegal?</p>
<ul> 
  <li>“The act of file sharing is not illegal per se and peer-to-peer networks are also used for legitimate purposes. The legal issues in file sharing involve violating the laws of copyrighted material. Most discussions about the legality of file sharing are implied to be about solely copyright material.”</li>
  </ul>

<p>What are the consequences of peer-to-peer file editing?</p>
<ul>
  <li>“The legal penalties for copyright infringement are: Infringer pays the actual dollar amount of damages and profits. The law provides a range from $200 to $150,000 for each work infringed. Infringer pays for all attorneys fees and court costs.” </li>
</ul>
  
<p>Does fair use apply to peer to peer copying and sharing?</p>
<ul>
  <li>“This relates to peer to peer file sharing because usually copying and sharing files infringes upon fair use laws, because completely copying a song, movie, or any other such thing is illegal and not abiding by fair use. ... Use of items on public domain is legal and unable to be persecuted by copyright law.” </li>
  </ul>
  <p>What are some examples of peer-to-peer software programs?</p>
  <ul>
<li>“Peer-to-peer (P2P) software allows “peers” (individual computer systems) to connect to each other over the internet to share files. Examples of mainstream P2P software programs include BitTorrent, Limewire, Ares and AresWarez, Kazaa, Azureus, DC++ and Morpheus.” </li>
  </ul>
  <p>What Is a Peer-To-Peer (P2P) Economy?</P>
<ul>
  <li>“A peer-to-peer (P2P) economy is a decentralized model whereby two individuals interact to buy sell goods and services directly with each other or produce goods and service together, without an intermediary third-party or the use of an incorporated entity or business firm.” </li>
</ul>
