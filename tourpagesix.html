"The National Museum of Bermuda, previously the Bermuda Maritime Museum from its opening in 1974 until 2009 (legislatively formalised in 2013), explores the maritime and island history of Bermuda.The maritime museum is located within the grounds of the fortress Keep of the former Royal Naval Dockyard in Sandys Parish on the Ireland Island at the western end of Bermuda. The museum explores more than 500 years of Bermuda’s history, from the settling of the island to its importance as a hub of shipping, sailing and boat making. The museum occupies several historic fortifications in the Royal Naval Dockyard, including the Commissioner’s House, Casemates Barracks and The Keep, Bermuda’s largest fort. Inside, you’ll see gold bars, jewellery and other treasures recovered from centuries-old shipwrecks by scuba diving archaeologists, or learn about the more than 90 forts around Bermuda in the Defence Heritage exhibit. And kids can crawl through a lighthouse and giant moray eel at the Museum Playground & Playhouse.”
